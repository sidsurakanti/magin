Cross products are a fundamental vector operation that produces a vector perpendicular to two input vectors. The key concepts to cover are:

1. Definition and geometric interpretation (perpendicular result)
2. Right-hand rule for direction
3. Magnitude calculation (area of parallelogram)
4. Component-wise calculation formula
5. Properties (anticommutative, distributive)

For optimal flow:
1. Start with geometric setup - two vectors in 3D space
2. Show the perpendicular result vector
3. Demonstrate right-hand rule
4. Show magnitude relates to parallelogram area
5. Break down the component formula
6. Quick properties summary

Layout choice: Layout B works best here since we need wide 3D-style vector diagrams and the component formula will be horizontally heavy with multiple vectors displayed.
