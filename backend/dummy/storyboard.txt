The user wants an animation about gradients. This is a fundamental concept in calculus and machine learning, so I should focus on the most intuitive explanation. 

The optimal structure would be:
1. Start with a simple function and show what a gradient represents visually
2. Show how gradients point in the direction of steepest increase
3. Demonstrate gradient calculation step-by-step
4. Show practical application (like gradient descent)

For layout, I'll use Layout A since this will involve both visual function plots and step-by-step mathematical explanations. The visuals won't be horizontally heavy, and I'll need space for computational walkthroughs.

The flow should build understanding progressively:
- Visual intuition first (function plot with gradient vectors)
- Mathematical definition and calculation
- Practical meaning and application

# Gradients Animation Sequence

## Step 1: Function and Gradient Visualization
**Duration: 8 seconds**

#### Layout
- Base Layout: Layout A
- Zone Contents:
    - Narration: "Gradients point in the direction of steepest increase"
    - Visuals: 2D function plot f(x,y) = x² + y² with gradient vectors at several points
    - Steps: "At each point, the gradient vector shows the steepest uphill direction"

#### Actions
- Create 2D coordinate system in left visual zone
- Plot contour lines of f(x,y) = x² + y² (circular contours)
- Add 4-5 gradient vectors at different points, all pointing radially outward
- Each vector is colored BLUE and properly scaled
- Add step explanation in right zone
- Display narration text at bottom

#### Active Elements
- Coordinate system, contour plot, gradient vectors, step text, narration text

#### Carry Over Elements
- Coordinate system and contour plot will continue to next step
- Gradient vectors will be modified in next step

#### Cleanup
- None needed for first step

## Step 2: Gradient Magnitude Visualization  
**Duration: 7 seconds**

#### Layout
- Base Layout: Layout A
- Zone Contents:
    - Narration: "Gradient magnitude shows how steep the slope is"
    - Visuals: Same function plot with gradient vectors of varying lengths
    - Steps: "Longer vectors = steeper slope, Shorter vectors = gentler slope"

#### Actions
- Remove previous step text and narration
- Modify existing gradient vectors to show varying magnitudes
- Vectors near origin (center) are shorter, vectors farther out are longer
- Highlight one short vector near center with YELLOW SurroundingRectangle
- Highlight one long vector far from center with RED SurroundingRectangle
- Add new step explanation and narration

#### Active Elements
- Coordinate system, contour plot, modified gradient vectors, highlights, step text, narration text

#### Carry Over Elements
- Coordinate system and contour plot continue to next step
- Will remove all vectors and highlights in next step

#### Cleanup
- Remove old step text and narration text before adding new ones

## Step 3: Mathematical Definition
**Duration: 10 seconds**

#### Layout
- Base Layout: Layout A

    - Visuals: Coordinate system with single point highlighted
    - Steps: Mathematical definition with computation

#### Actions
- Remove all gradient vectors and highlights from previous step
- Add single point P at (2,1) with RED dot
- In steps zone, show mathematical definition:
  - "∇f = (∂f/∂x, ∂f/∂y)"
  - "For f(x,y) = x² + y²:"
  - "∂f/∂x = 2x"
  - "∂f/∂y = 2y"
- Each line appears sequentially with brief pause
- Add narration at bottom

#### Active Elements

- Keep point P highlighted at (2,1)
- In steps zone, show calculation sequence:
  - "At point (2,1):"
  - "∇f(2,1) = (2(2), 2(1))"
  - "∇f(2,1) = (4, 2)"
- Each calculation line appears in sequence, previous line shifts up
- Add gradient vector (4,2) at point P in BLUE
- Update narration

#### Active Elements
- Coordinate system, contour plot, point P, calculation lines, gradient vector at P, narration text

#### Carry Over Elements

- Each step shows: current point → gradient vector → next point (opposite direction)
- Path appears progressively with small pauses
- Add step explanation about moving opposite to gradient
- Final point near origin highlighted with GREEN SurroundingRectangle

#### Active Elements
